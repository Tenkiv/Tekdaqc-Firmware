\section{Data Structures}
Here are the data structures with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_analog___input__t}{Analog\-\_\-\-Input\-\_\-t} \\*Data structure used to store the state and requirements of an analog input to the Tekdaqc. This data structure contains all the information related to a particular input to the Tekdaqc, including values and allowable range. Please note that while there is nothing to stop you from manipulating the values of the structure directly, it is not recommended as it could put the structure in an indeterminate state. Instead, manipulation functions are provided which will ensure that all state related implications are addressed }{\pageref{struct_analog___input__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_calibration_state__t}{Calibration\-State\-\_\-t} \\*Data structure for keeping track of the current state of the calibration process }{\pageref{struct_calibration_state__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_digital___input__t}{Digital\-\_\-\-Input\-\_\-t} \\*Data structure used to store the state and requirements of a digital input to the Tekdaqc. This data structure contains all the information related to a particular input to the Tekdaqc. Please note that while there is nothing to stop you from manipulating the values of the structure directly, it is not recommended as it could put the structure in an indeterminate state. Instead, manipulation functions are provided which will ensure that all state related implications are addressed }{\pageref{struct_digital___input__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_digital___output__t}{Digital\-\_\-\-Output\-\_\-t} \\*Data structure used to store the state and requirements of a digital output of the Tekdaqc. This data structure contains all the information related to a particular input to the Tekdaqc. Please note that while there is nothing to stop you from manipulating the values of the structure directly, it is not recommended as it could put the structure in an indeterminate state. Instead, manipulation functions are provided which will ensure that all state related implications are addressed }{\pageref{struct_digital___output__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_tekdaqc___command_interpreter__t}{Tekdaqc\-\_\-\-Command\-Interpreter\-\_\-t} \\*Data structure for maintaining the state of the command interpreter }{\pageref{struct_tekdaqc___command_interpreter__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_telnet_opts__t}{Telnet\-Opts\-\_\-t} \\*Telnet options state structure. A structure that contains the state of the options supported by the telnet server, along with the possible flags }{\pageref{struct_telnet_opts__t}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{struct_telnet_server__t}{Telnet\-Server\-\_\-t} \\*Data structure to hold the state of the Telnet server. Contains all of the necessary state variables to impliment the Telnet server. Direct manipulation of these members is not recommended as it may leave the server in an inconsistent state. Instead, helper methods are provided which will ensure that all necessary operations occur as a result of any change }{\pageref{struct_telnet_server__t}}{}
